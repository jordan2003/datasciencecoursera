# Getting and Cleaning Data - Coursera - Project

This is a simple "how-to" to run the code:
the few first lines of the "run_analysis.R" will install and load the libraries required to download, load the required packages and libraries. if you already have these packages ready. please comment the below lines:

 
 
 #install.packages("downloader") 
 #require(downloader) 
 #install.packages("plyr") 
 
 
 the file will download the zip file in the current working Directory and unzip the contents is the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder name.
 Then it follows by reading each of them and starts cleaning and tiding up the data
